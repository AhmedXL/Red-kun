# aikaterna-cogs
v3 Cogs for Red-DiscordBot by Twentysix26.

away - Originally by Paddo, written for v3 by Axas, final tests by aikaterna. Set and unset a user as being "away".

blurplefy - Make an avatar or an image upload blurple for Discord's 3rd anniversary.

chatchart - Generates a pie chart to display chat activity over the last 5000 messages. Requested by violetnyte.

dungeon - New users with new accounts will be shuffled off to a locked channel on-join to help mitigate raiders. Please see the dungeon_readme.md file on this repo for more information.

joinleave - Alerts a set channel when an account under a certain age of days joins a server and leaves within the set time... any server the bot can see. This is a global cog with owner only commands. I wrote this for myself so I won't be adding user requests for the most part, and will be using it to combat the recent user scrapers found joining and leaving servers quickly.

inspirobot - Fetch "inspirational" messages from inspirobot.me with [p]inspireme.

nolinks - A very blunt hammer to remove anything that looks like a link. Roles can be whitelisted and it can watch multiple channels.

otherbot - Alert a role when bot(s) go offline.

partycrash - A port of Will's partycrash command from the v2 Admin cog. This cog will not generate invites, but will show already-existing invites that the bot has access to view.

pingtime - Show all shards' pingtimes.

retrosign - A v3 port of Anismash's retrosign cog: https://github.com/Anismash/Ani-Cogs/tree/master/retrosign

rndstatus - A v3 port of Twentysix's rndstatus cog with a couple extra settings.

timezone - A v3 port of Fishyfing's timezone cog with a few improvements.

trickortreat - A trick or treat-based competitive candy eating game with a leaderboard and other fun commands like stealing candy from guildmates.

tools - A collection of mod and admin tools, ported from my v2 version. Sitryk is responsible for a lot of the code in tools... thanks for the help with this cog.

wolfram - A v3 port of Paddo's abandoned Wolfram Alpha cog.

Are you looking for the v3 lavalink music cog? It's been added to Red v3 as the audio module. Install from develop and ask in the Red support server for help if you need it, or join my server. https://discord.gg/th6eS3T
